      text: Passed my test first time because of this app. It has all 34 DVSA hazard
        perception video clips, 10 case studies that cover real-life scenarios,
        all the questions from the DVSA practice bank. It also allows me to
        search for terms. Finally, just before the test, I was able to revise
        all the questions that I found difficult thanks to the review feature.
